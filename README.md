New to Github
My names Alan and I'm 22 and I'm from Florida just getting out the Marines and I'm trying my hardest to be a coder and learn as much as I can before I get out. Currently I am mainly self taught and learned HTML, some CSS, Python, and finishing Java now. I'm no pro since I am still new so I hope anyone can try and teach me anything beacuse I'm eager as hell to learn and create projects that stand out from others.
